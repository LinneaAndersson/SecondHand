==================================================================
Important things that must be done for the success of the project:

- Implementation

* Write unit tests for the model(start doing this once we know that the model is 100% stable )
* Fix a texture for slowdown powerup.
* We sometimes get negative lives for some reason.
* Replace some property changes with some kind of interface or
callback method instead. - Done, but just changed the propertyChange.

- Documentation

* We must also update the class diagram for the model(in the RAD).
* Describe the MVC model in the SDD.
* Make 2 sequence diagrams(use something like graphviz)

=================================
Things we can do if we have time:

* Make a prettier hud.
* make the menus look prettier.
* Player movement with particles.
* Make the Player grow bigger more smooth. (grow in small steps)
* When collision, remove bodies earlier.
* Better level transition
* Improve the level generation
* Fix PowerUpFactory.
