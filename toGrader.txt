The name of the game is Twist. Twist/ is the main folder you want to
look in. TwirlTestTest/ has all the tests.

When you use gitinspector, add these flags:
-x andengine -x badlogic

See Twist/.pmd for the PMD settings we decided to use.

All the documentation can be found on the documentation branch.

A version of the game you can install on your android-mobile can be
found at SecondHand/Twirl.apk. Due to bugs in AndEninge, we cannot
guarantee that it will work on your phone without crashing, but on
your phones it performs well until about the third level of the game,
where it usually crashes. We apologize for this.
