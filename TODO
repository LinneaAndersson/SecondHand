==================================================================
Important things that must be done for the success of the project:

- Implementation

* Write unit tests for the model(start doing this once we know that the model is 100% stable )
* Make sure that the entities are not placed top of each other in the level generation
* Fix a texture for slowdown powerup.
* We sometimes get negative lives for some reason.
* Replace some property changes with some kind of interface or
callback method instead. - Done, but just changed the propertyChange.

* In the HighScoreList and LocalizationStrings classes there is code
that uses the android operating system to load files and access the
localization strings. This means that our model is tied to the android
operating system. Refactor out the code that uses the Android OS
to the view, or something.

- Documentation

* Update the UC Enemy move to reflect how we ended up implementing the enemy AI.
Andreas should be the one to do this, as he was the one who
implemented a majority of it, so he understands it the best.
* We must also update the class diagram for the model(in the RAD).
* Describe the MVC model in the SDD.
* Make 2 sequence diagrams(use something like graphviz)

=================================
Things we can do if we have time:

* Make a prettier hud.
* make the menus look prettier.
* Player movement with particles.
* Make the Player grow bigger more smooth. (grow in small steps)
* When collision, remove bodies earlier.
* Better level transition
* Improve the level generation
* Fix PowerUpFactory.
